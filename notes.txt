active Client in global state

Admin Page needs
    Pings within range. Potentially move pings into client to improve performance if making the data request after filters are set
    in this case, we'll need good default values for initial load. 
        proposed default behaviour:
            full range of time series values in the new get all ping for client endpoint

User Page needs
    Most recent ping (think about this part more, what does that mean? when do i pull it? how do i keep it up to date?)
    All pings to create daily bins
    



Alternate!!
    Pull all pings for client when you select the client/refresh clients.
    set icon color in root sidebar based on most recent value(gradient or treshold?) --- how do we get this?
